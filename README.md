## Building WebComponents with Polymer
In this exercise, you get started with the new [W3C Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) WebComponents. You can find a good introduction at [webcomponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction):
> Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.
>
> Web components are based on existing web standards. Features to support web components are currently being added to the HTML and DOM specs, letting web developers easily extend HTML with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.

You can develope WebComponents in plain HTML, CSS and JS. Although we are going to use [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) by Google for this exercise. Polymer is a lightwight library which makes developing WebComponents easier. With the CLI it's simple to load and test componetns and there is no need to care about if every browser supports the latest APIs.
